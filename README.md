# UI Kit schemas & type definitions

This project defines an API developers can use to build fully interactive & accessible experiences using straightforward, serializeable props.

This includes a set of JSON schemas from which TypeScript definitions are derived and used in the development of the design system implementation.

## Getting started

Install `node` greater than or equal to v10 and `yarn`, then run:

```shell
$ yarn install
```

Then, to start Storybook and watch the JSON schemas, run:

```shell
$ yarn dev
```

To only build TypeScript types from the JSON schemas once, run:

```shell
$ yarn build
```
