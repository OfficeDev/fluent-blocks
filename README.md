## ⚠️ Not yet recommended for production

This project is still being vetted. If you want to use Fluent Blocks, please bear in mind even non-prereleases don’t yet come with any particular guarantees.

For the best experience specify a specific version of Fluent Blocks when installing instead of using `~`/`^`/`*`, tags, or ranges. If you encounter issues or when you want to use new features, migrate to a newer version with care.
