# Inlines

Inlines are elements with content that can string together to form potentially wrapping lines. The expectation is they will always lay out in the [inline direction first, then the block direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Logical_Properties). Inlines should use `em` for their dimensions so a parent element can assign their size.
