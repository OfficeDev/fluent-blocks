## What is Fluent Blocks?

If you need to deliver software experiences in the Fluent design system, Fluent Blocks gives you the tools you need to deliver accessible and polished experiences just using JSON, so you can focus more on the content and leave the rest to these components.

When you use Fluent Blocks, you aren’t locked into its way of doing things. The components also provide plenty of opportunities to make the exceptions you need to make to deliver designs optimized for your app’s use-case. It’s a bundle-friendly library that ships components that can handle entire fully-composed experiences down to more intermediate patterns that help with specific features like charts.
