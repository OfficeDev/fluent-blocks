# Props

This directory contains non-trivial or shared React-specific schema extensions.

Generally types and extensions should be defined alongside the relevant
component, however if these become shared or non-trivial it can cause circular
dependencies or just make the code harder to reason about. In those cases, the
types should be defined here.
