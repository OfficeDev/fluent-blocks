# Communication

A big centered illustration with some content underneath. Used for error messages, empty states, success messages, etc.

### Welcome Screens

For a welcome screen on a first-run experience, use an inviting illustration or branding. It should give users a sense of what your app does and offer first steps for getting started.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Welcome">
    <Communication
      illustration="hello"
      title="Welcome to Contoso! Your opinion counts."
      description="Contoso is your tool to create, take, and manage polls."
      actions={[
        {
          label: 'Sign in',
          variant: 'primary',
        },
        {
          label: 'Sign up',
          variant: 'secondary',
        },
        {
          label: 'Learn more about Contoso',
          variant: 'tertiary',
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Welcome B">
    <Communication
      illustration="hello"
      title="Welcome to your workspace, Daniela"
      description="Access all your boards for photos, files, and tasks from a single place."
      actions={[
        {
          label: 'Create a board',
          variant: 'primary',
        },
        {
          label: 'Find an existing board',
          variant: 'secondary',
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## No Data

A no data state should provide clear direction on the next steps to populate the page. Sometimes there may not be an action for the user to take. In those cases, actions are not required but text should clearly explain what the user can expect from the page in the future.

### With actions

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Empty with Actions">
    <Communication
      illustration="empty"
      actions={[
        {
          label: 'Create a task',
          variant: 'primary',
        },
        {
          label: 'Find an existing task',
          variant: 'secondary',
        },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

### Without actions

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Empty">
    <Communication
      illustration="empty"
      title="Once you're assigned a task, you'll find it here"
      description="Until then, enjoy your time off."
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Error

Error states come in many different forms. Consider an appropriate illustration to ease the pain convey next steps to resolve the issue.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Error">
    <Communication illustration="error" title="Something went wrong" />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Error B">
    <Communication
      title="Something went wrong"
      description="Try searching with common words or checking for spelling errors."
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>
