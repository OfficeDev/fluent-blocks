# Card

Cards are used to elevate and encapsulate related content.

While `Card` elements are probably most often used as content items of a
`Layout` element to goup content as items in a list, the pattern can also be
used to group content as a regular Block element as well.

### As a Block element

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story
    name="Card as a Block"
    args={{
      theme: 'light',
      card: [
        {
          paragraph: [{ text: 'This is a Card as a regular Block element.' }],
          level: 1,
        },
        { paragraph: [{ text: fake('{{lorem.paragraph}}') }] },
      ],
    }}
  >
    {seed(1234) || CardBlockTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Card as a Block" />

### As a Layout item

<Canvas withSource="none">
  <Story
    name="Card as a Layout item"
    args={{
      theme: 'light',
      card: [
        {
          paragraph: [{ text: 'This is a Card as a layout item.' }],
          level: 1,
        },
        { paragraph: [{ text: fake('{{lorem.paragraph}}') }] },
      ],
    }}
  >
    {seed(1234) || CardLayoutTemplate.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Card as a Layout item" />
